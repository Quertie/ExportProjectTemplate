# Introduction

There is currently no way to export Visual Studio project templates via command-line.
This tool aims to do just that, enabling devs to produce project templates from within their CI pipelines.

# Limitations

This application was botched together for a specific project, so all possibilities were not necessarily considered.
Feel free to adapt the tool to your needs and why not submit a pull request if you wish to contribute.
